				<p><strong>CN WebTranslater Assignment</strong> </p>
				<p>This assignment had as purpose to program an HTTP application on a TCP Server using only the Socket library of Java.
					Doing this we propose different METHODS that are supported on our server.

				<h2>Methods</h2>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p><strong>HTTP</strong> is a pretty extensible protocol.
					It relies on a few basic concepts like the notion of resources and URIs,
					a simple structure of messages, and a client-server structure for the communication flow.
					On top of these basic concepts, numerous extensions have appeared over the years,
					adding new functionality and new semantics by creating new HTTP methods or headers.</p>

		<section>
			<header>
				<h3>GET</h3>
			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p> The GET method requests transfer of a current selected representation
					for the target resource. GET is the primary mechanism of information
					retrieval and the focus of almost all performance optimizations.
					Hence, when people speak of retrieving some identifiable information
					via HTTP, they are generally referring to making a GET request.</p>
			</div>
		</section>
		<!-- Section -->
		<section>
			<header>
				<h3>HEAD</h3>

			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT
					send a message body in the response (i.e., the response terminates at
					the end of the header section). The server SHOULD send the same
					header fields in response to a HEAD request as it would have sent if
					the request had been a GET, except that the payload header fields
					(Section 3.3) MAY be omitted. This method can be used for obtaining
					metadata about the selected representation without transferring the
					representation data and is often used for testing hypertext links for
					validity, accessibility, and recent modification.</p>
			</div>
		</section>

		<!-- Section -->
		<section>
			<header>
				<h3>POST</h3>

			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p> The POST method requests that the target resource process the
					representation enclosed in the request according to the resource's
					own specific semantics. For example, POST is used for the following
					functions (among others):

					o Providing a block of data, such as the fields entered into an HTML
					form, to a data-handling process;


					o Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list,
					blog, or similar group of articles;

					o Creating a new resource that has yet to be identified by the
					origin server; and

					o Appending data to a resource's existing representation(s).
				</p>
			</div>
		</section>
		<section>
			<header>
				<h3>PUT</h3>

			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>The PUT method requests that the state of the target resource be
					created or replaced with the state defined by the representation
					enclosed in the request message payload. A successful PUT of a given
					representation would suggest that a subsequent GET on that same
					target resource will result in an equivalent representation being
					sent in a 200 (OK) response. However, there is no guarantee that

					such a state change will be observable, since the target resource
					might be acted upon by other user agents in parallel, or might be
					subject to dynamic processing by the origin server, before any
					subsequent GET is received. A successful response only implies that
					the user agent's intent was achieved at the time of its processing by
					the origin server.</p>
